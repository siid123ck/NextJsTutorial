## Introduction
NextJs is react framework for building fullstack application. Basically we use React to build user interface and next for additional features. 

### NextJs features 
- **Rendering:** server-side rendering which enhances page load times and SEO by rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client.

- **Static Site Generation :** Next.js supports SSG, allowing you to pre-render pages at build time.
  
- **Routing:** File-system based routing supports layout, nested routing, error handling, loading states. 

- **API Routes:** You can create serverless API routes within your Next.js application, simplifying backend development.

- **CSS Support:** Next.js offers various options for styling, including CSS Modules, Styled Components, tailwind and CSS-in-JS.


## Getting Started
### Installation 
Run following command to set up everything: 
` npx create-next-app@latest ` 
After you run that command you'll see following prompts: 
```
√ What is your project named? ... first-app
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... No / Yes

```
You can choose the option according your preference, in this tutorial I did not use typescript, ESLint. I chose App router for this tutorial as this has additional feature, 
however you can choose No (page router).
